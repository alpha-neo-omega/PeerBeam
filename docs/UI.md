# UI (Flutter)

The v2 Flutter client — a modern, responsive Material 3 shell that mirrors
v1's screens (Home, Transfers, History, Settings) with **no new features**.
It renders against a mock state layer for now; the Rust engine wires in at the
FFI milestone. This deliberately fixes the issues raised in the UI audit.

## Structure

```
lib/
  main.dart                 root: AppState + router, theme-only rebuilds
  app/
    theme.dart              Material 3 seed → light/dark; motion + breakpoint tokens
    router.dart             go_router StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack (state-preserving)
    shell.dart              responsive nav: bar / rail / extended rail
  state/
    models.dart             view models (Device, Transfer, HistoryItem)
    stores.dart             per-domain ChangeNotifiers + sample data
    app_scope.dart          InheritedWidget exposing AppState
  widgets/                  StatusDot, DeviceTile, QuickAction, EmptyState, Appear, …
  features/{home,transfers,history,settings}/
```

## How the audit findings were addressed

| Audit finding | Resolution |
|---|---|
| N1 tabs lose state on switch | `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack` keeps every tab alive |
| N2 no declarative routing / deep links | `go_router` with URL-addressable branches |
| N3 no back handling | Router-integrated navigation (system back works) |
| A1 zero Semantics | `StatusDot`, `DeviceTile`, `QuickAction` carry semantic labels / `button` roles; `MergeSemantics` on tiles |
| A2 icon buttons without tooltips | Every `IconButton` has a tooltip |
| A4 status by colour only | `StatusDot` exposes "Online/Offline" to a11y and is paired with text |
| R1 content doesn't reflow / no max width | Content capped to a readable width; device list is a responsive `SliverGrid` (columns by width) |
| R2 orientation locked | No orientation lock |
| P1 whole-tree rebuilds on god-provider | Per-domain stores; each screen `AnimatedBuilder`s only the store it needs |
| P3 non-builder ListViews | `ListView.builder` / `SliverGrid.builder` everywhere |

## Modern / native touches

- Material 3 throughout, tonal light + dark from one seed; system/light/dark
  switch (segmented control in Settings).
- Adaptive navigation: bottom bar < 600px, rail < 1000px, extended rail
  beyond — one shell, three layouts.
- Motion: shared duration/curve tokens; `SliverAppBar.large` collapsing
  header, staggered list entrances (`Appear`), animated progress bars,
  pulsing presence dots, animated scan toggle.
- Platform-adaptive controls (`Switch.adaptive`) and a transfer-count `Badge`
  on the nav.

## Drag & drop (desktop only)

`DropZone` (in `features/send/`) wraps the whole content area. On desktop
(Linux/macOS/Windows) it accepts dropped files; on mobile/web it is a
transparent passthrough. Dropped items are **staged by path + size only** —
never read into memory — so dropping many files or multi-GB files is instant.
A dashed, tinted `DropOverlay` fades/scales in while dragging, then the
staged-files sheet opens for review (per-file remove, running total). Staging
lives in a pure `StagingStore` (dedup by path), unit-tested independently of
any native drag.

## Verification

`flutter analyze` — no issues. `flutter test` — boots-to-Home smoke test
passes. (Native desktop/Android builds require their platform toolchains,
not run here.)

## Not yet

Engine wiring (FFI) — all actions currently show a placeholder. App-level
transfer-approval handling, QR pairing, and localization land with the bridge.
